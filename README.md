# Suduko-game
 This code represents a complete implementation of a Sudoku game with user account management.
 
Account Management:
     Users can create an account with a username and password.
     The account data (score, games played, games won, and unfinished games) is saved in a file with the username.
     Users can log in with an existing account, or if they do not have one, they can either sign up or play as guests.
     Account data is also stored in a central database (db.txt) for managing multiple users.
     
Sudoku Game Logic:
     A Sudoku grid of 9x9 is created and populated with numbers, following Sudoku rules (numbers 1-9 must not repeat in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
     The game is played by entering row, column, and the number the player wants to insert.
     The player can save their progress, load a saved game, or delete a saved game from the available slots.
     The difficulty of the game can be adjusted to "easy", "medium", or "hard", which corresponds to the number of initially hidden cells in the grid.

Game Flow:
     The game can be started by the user either as a guest or by logging into an account.
     There is a validation system that ensures numbers are placed correctly according to Sudoku rules.
     Players can make moves, and they receive feedback if they try to place an invalid number.
     Players can also save their game, load a previously saved game, or start a new game. If the user reaches 3 errors, they lose the game.

File Operations:
     Account information is saved and loaded from text files, and the grid state of unfinished games is stored for future sessions.

Game End Conditions:
When the Sudoku grid is filled correctly, the game congratulates the player, updates their score, and allows them to start a new game or exit.
The game ends when the user decides to quit or after a specified number of errors.
